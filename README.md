# Bio-Ionic Memristor Characterization Platform

A hardware–software system to **characterize a bio-ionic memristor** and evaluate its **memory, reliability, and synaptic (neuromorphic) behavior** using an ESP32, INA219, and Python-based analysis.

---

## Overview

This project enables:
- Controlled **voltage pulses and sweeps**
- **Current and voltage measurement** of a memristor device
- Automated data logging
- Extraction of **memristor and synaptic metrics** such as:
  - Vset / Vreset
  - ON/OFF ratio
  - Retention and endurance
  - STP, LTP, and PPF curves

The system is designed to be **modular, reproducible, and report-ready**.
