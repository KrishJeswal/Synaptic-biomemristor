# Bio-Ionic Memristor Characterization

A minimal hardware–software platform to characterize a bio-ionic memristor using an ESP32, INA219, and Python.

The system applies voltage pulses/sweeps, measures current response, and logs data for analysis.

Key outcomes include:
- I–V hysteresis and switching (Vset, Vreset)
- ON/OFF ratio
- Retention and endurance
- Synaptic behavior (STP, LTP, PPF)

ESP32 generates stimuli, INA219 senses current, and Python handles control, logging, and analysis.
